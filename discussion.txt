 what it's the instructions ??
A command-line software development consisting of three to five digits of four operations exercises is independently completed.
The basic functional requirements of the software are as follows:
1)	 The program can receive an input parameter n, and then randomly generate n-channel addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) exercises. Each number is between 0 and 100, and the operator is between 3 and 5.
2)	After the exercise has been generated, output your Student ID and the generated n-channel exercises and their correct answers to the file "result.txt", do not output additional information, the file directory is consistent with the program directory.
 
this is an example for n =2 (equations withe the result)
